**I believe that people & product are the fundamental units of any business.** As such, I enjoy discussions centered on the intersection of design, technology, business, and the capital markets.

I particularly enjoy traveling and hiking which I've channeled into a hobby taking photos wherever I go. Additionally, I like to work out, cook, and root for Penn State football.

### Running Reference of Achievements

#### 2015

I joined Lamp Post Group in Chattanooga, TN, as part of a grand experiment -- Lamp Post Labs, an innovation lab. In December, I transitioned to my current role and began laying out the roadmap for Dynamo.

#### 2014

I grew restless and had decided to further explore Product Management and joined [General Assembly's Project Management](https://generalassemb.ly) program in NYC.

#### 2013

I left my first job at Citi and joined Wells Fargo to learn about the technology sector at a deeper level. Specifically, my team covered the IT Hardware & Wireless Equipment industries.

#### 2010

I also spent the year (2009-2010) as a Donor Relations Captain for [Penn State Dance MaraTHON](http://www.thon.org). I'm a proud alumn of the world's largest student-run philanthropy focused on aiding families fighting pediatric cancer.

In May, graduated from Penn State with a BS Finance and Minor Information Systems Management and promptly joined Citi's Investment Banking program where I joined the Insurance practice.

#### 2009

My cofounders and I sold Bullish Bankers for 4.0x our initial investment after deciding to pursue careers on Wall Street out of college. 2009 also market a year where I helped oversee the IT allocation for [The Nittany Lion Fund](http://www.smeal.psu.edu/nittany-lion-fund/), outperforming the S&P 500 IT Benchmark by 6.37%.

#### 2008

Along with three other classmates, I cofounded and sold Bullish Bankers, a financial community after spending a summer at Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) in international operations. Bullish Bankers did well by any standard with a wide syndication and partnership with Jim Cramer's [TheStreet.com](http://www.thestreet.com).

I was the sole Sophomore to compete in the impromptu case competition, The Next CEO and took third place against a field of ten other preeminent juniors and seniors at Smeal. The Next CEO presented a series of strategic scenarios that were framed by CSIS's [The Seven Revolutions]() to which participants responded. The program was judged by executives from a variety of Fortune 500 companies.

#### 2006

I enrolled at Penn State after graduating from River Hill High School. After getting a swift kick to the head from reality, I reset, refocused, and became [The Nittany Lion Fund's](http://www.smeal.psu.edu/nittany-lion-fund/) first Fund Administrator.

I wound down Razor Studios, a business I had founded to provide technology support to small businesses and consumers.

#### 1999

I learned HTML in 6th grade and coded my first site from scratch on the history of [Hershey Chocolate](http://hersheychocolate.tripod.com). Previously, in 1998, I had built a webpage using Netscape Composer to present my learnings regarding The War of 1812.

I was first exposed to code by my Dad who booted up the BASIC interpreter on a Compaq Presario in 1995.
