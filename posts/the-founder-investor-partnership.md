The commentary from the VC community has been increasingly cautious, parlayed with a gradual reduction in valuations both in carrying values as well as early stage financings. The tone seems to be signaling a shift where the dynamics between Founders and Investors are coming back to some level of equilibrium. Where previously Founders might have had the upper hand in the era of “fast and easy money,” Investors are getting increasingly vocal especially as it relates to liquidity and realizing gains.

We have a lot to learn from more experienced VCs, and Fred Wilson’s [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUV6c2-r6uI) at the Upfront Summit is one for the books. Wilson made bold remarks regarding companies avoiding IPOs and opting to stay private. While there are manners through which an investor can realize gains in private markets, the IPO is an important source of liquidity for VCs and one that Founders cannot avoid forever.

​The relationship between a Founder and Investor is a partnership, both sides should stand benefit. In venture capital, the investor role has been defined with details on what separates great VCs from the good — socratic, deep expertise, ardent support of founder teams, et al. Similarly, there’s lots of perspective and discussion around building a good company. I think one of the understated points is the *implied fiduciary duty Founders have when they take outside capital*. If a startup scales and is performing reasonably well (this doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be cashflow positive or reporting profits), *it’s an unstated but implied responsibility to make reasonable efforts to return capital to investors*.

All said and done, a company has several metrics to determine success, many of which contribute to total value creation. Total Value Creation is very much a philosophical debate but I’ve yet to meet a sensible and successful leader that doesn’t view shareholder returns as a component of it. Shareholder returns however, aren’t achieved, until realized by investors.

​I would expect more discussion (and maybe even demands) from investors around liquidity as successful companies continue to stay private. Ultimately, the best leaders and businesses find a way to manage this facet of operating a business — running from an IPO isn’t the answer.
