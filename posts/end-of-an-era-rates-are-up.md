Rates have been in the doldrums since I graduated college over five years ago and began cutting my teeth on Wall Street. Now, I’m blessed and lucky to sit in Chattanooga, blending my experience in finance and understanding of product, working on building my dream. Needless to say, I look at the Fed increase today through a very different lens. I’m not in a model driven world, I’m thinking at a higher level and the impact on fund flows.

The rate increase 0.25% or 25bps for all you finance nerds out there, signaled the end of an era (that I wish came sooner). The FMOC, with a level of confidence, believes that the economy is on sound footing with inflation projected to be around 2.00%. For those wondering, a low level of inflation is good, it’s deflation that’s an ultimate nightmare in the world of economics.
Capital flows across and within a variety of asset classes. It generally chases opportunities that deliver a reasonable return for the risk assumed. In the last eight years, you saw investors who might have generally looked at bonds for yield, look at lower quality issues or even move to stocks. Similarly, you saw public equity investors shift into later rounds in the private market in hopes of generating great growth-based returns. Even in the private capital markets, more specifically, venture capital, late stage investors went down the spectrum (towards Seed and Series A) when looking for investments.

The news of this increase is important and significant in the realm of economics and monetary policy. Ultimately, I don’t think 0.25% is going to drastically impact capital flows and we’ll likely see the same cross over behaviors. That being said, perhaps the way things are now won’t change, and this is the “new normal.” I for one will be interested to see how investors behave as rates steadily go up and how that impacts capital flows
