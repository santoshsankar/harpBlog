I’ve been thinking about the cognitive biases involved in investing, more specifically early stage investing. If we can identify them, we can work to correct them. One’s biases can result in poor decision making across the board. After observing, and reflecting on conversations and exchanges I’ve had related to investment evaluation, one notable bias emerged.

Investing is a discipline largely driven by opinions. A team must do their diligence and formulate their opinions. The variables and factors that go into diligence are often very subjective and can be shaped by one’s bias. While investors leverage financials in later stage investing, that approach doesn’t work in the early innings of a business. It’s a different ball game, one centered around people and their abilities.

In the early stage, most investors focus on some variant of the following:

1. Team
2. Traction
3. Market
4. Product

The Team is extremely important given that **people build businesses and it requires a variety of skills and personalities to come together in order to execute on a vision**. Put another way, a team of “bad apples” can turn a great business into a bad one, and run it into the ground (Enron, WorldCom). As such, it takes time to get to know people and a founding team is no different. Some investors can move faster than others and there are signs of promise that can emerge early on (track record, teachability, tenacity, et al) — such pattern matching comes through experience.

I’ve noticed in discussions that investors often overlook the fact that *they’re not the ones leading a company*. They bias their diligence by donning the “Leader Lens” and make judgements and evaluations based on what they think the company should do. **It boils down to trusting the Founders’ vision and ability to execute**.

While an investor can influence Founders and be a point of advice, they’re one of many sounding boards a Founding team uses. As businesses grow, different investors and stakeholders come into the fold with various perspectives. Founders are ultimately the decision makers around what to do and how to go about it. Investors must find comfort in the fact that the Founders are the captain of the ship, and have their investors along as a supporting partner.
